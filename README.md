## CNN for Time Series Analysis of Satellite Image Data

This code was used to generate the output for the CGIAR Crop Yield Prediction Challenge. The raw data set can be downloaded from the URL https://zindi.africa/competitions/cgiar-crop-yield-prediction-challenge.

First, for a given crop field, the raw satellite image data set was converted into a C x N x P matrix of histograms (where C denotes the number of channels, N denotes the number of histogram bins, and P denotes the number of time points) in a manner similar to that described by You et al. (2017). Next, a CNN was developed to estimate the crop yield using the 3D histograms as input.

**RMSE (as per Zindi dashboard): 1.855**
